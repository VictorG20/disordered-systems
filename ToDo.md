# To Do

## 2.1 Direct Diagonalization
- Document all functions.

## 2.2 Cavity Method

- Multiply vector by sparse matrix?
- Sample Gaussian Wigner Matrix.
- Create a new group “cavity_method” within [exercise2.h5](data/exercise2.h5). Inside this group, a dataset must consist of:
        - The Gaussian Wigner Matrix as a sparse matrix, labeled by size and mean connectivity.
        - Eigenvalues of the matrix obtained by direct diagonalization, labeled by size and mean connectivity.
        - Datasets of cavity values, labeled by its epsilon value.
